## SQL Injection
### Cheat Sheet
- Cheat Sheet can be found [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet)

### Notes
To do further injection, the first thing we should check is the number of columns. We can use this query `' ORDER BY {number}`, and if we see the server is crashed, for example, when injecting `' ORDER BY 3`, it means that the database has 2 columns. 

### Labs
```shell
# can be used to retrive hidden data and bypass authentication
\' OR 1 = 1 -- -
# querying the database type and version on Oracle
\' SELECT banner FROM v$version
```
